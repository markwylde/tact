# tact
This is an example project showing how the concept of hooks works entirely from scratch, with no React, JSX or dependencies.

There is no dom diffing or optimisation, so you don't want to use this for anything.

The `tact.js` file is the module, and the `index.js` is the example.

## Running
It uses es6 imports, so no build step is required.

Use your favourite web server engine, or:

```
npm install --global local-web-server
ws
```
